# car-rental
A project in which our team created a database for a fictional car rental company. This was done for our Database Management Systems class at Minnesota State University, Mankato in Fall 2017.

Team Members: 

Aaron Morley, Michael Doran, Dylan Jech, Stephen Tidjani, Joshua Ramczyk

Project Goal:

Create an ERD for the company, an SQL Database, a MySQL Database, and a PHP & HTML form to retrieve data from the server.

Form:

HTML and PHP code that we wrote in order to help the user interact with the server.

Business:

Business rules and the ERD that lays out our plan for the car rental company.

SQL:

MDF/LOG files for the SQL Database and SQL code written for the requirements of the project.
