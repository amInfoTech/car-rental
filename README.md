# car-rental
A project in which our team created a database for a fictional car rental company. This was done for our Database Management Systems class at Minnesota State University, Mankato in Fall 2017.

Team Members: Aaron Morley, Michael Doran, Dylan Jech, Stephen Tidjani, Joshua Ramczyk

Project Goal:
Create an ERD for the company, an SQL Database, a MySQL Database, and a PHP & HTML form to retrieve data from the server.
